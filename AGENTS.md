## 1. Project Purpose

**go-trakt** is an idiomatic Go client library for the **Trakt.tv API v2** (`https://api.trakt.tv`).
Its goal is to provide a strongly typed, memory-efficient client with zero external
dependencies, primarily consumed by **Dango** and any Go application that requires
interaction with Trakt's movies, TV shows, watch history, scrobbling engine,
and cross-catalog ID resolution.

This library does not implement Dango domain logic, Plex webhook handling, or local
database operations; it is a standalone, agnostic client library.

## 3. Build / Test / Lint Commands

```bash
# Compile library
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...

# Run unit tests
go test -v ./...

# Static analysis
go vet ./...
```

## 4. Go Style Rules

See full details in `docs/ai/go-style.md`. Summary:

- Errors must always be wrapped using `%w` (`fmt.Errorf("trakt: %s: %w", op, err)`).
- `context.Context` must be the first parameter in all functions performing I/O or network calls.
- No mutable global variables, no shared mutable state, and no `init()` functions.
- Client configured via functional options in `NewClient(clientID string, opts ...ClientOption)`.
- Table-driven unit tests using `t.Run` and exclusive use of `httptest.Server` (zero real-network calls in tests).
- Strict `CGO_ENABLED=0` compatibility.
- Zero external dependencies beyond the Go standard library.
- Responses must be decoded using streaming `json.NewDecoder` bounded by `io.LimitReader(body, maxBytes)`.

---

## 5. Commit Convention

Format: `<type>(<scope>)<!>: <description>`

- Allowed types: `feat fix docs style refactor perf test build ci chore revert`
- Mandatory scope when applicable (e.g. `feat(client)`, `docs(design)`).
- Description in English, imperative mode, lowercase, no trailing period, <= 72 characters.
- Atomic commits per logical change. Never `--amend` or `push --force`.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or personal credentials.

---

## 6. Resource and Memory Budget

- Ultra-lightweight: zero external dependencies (`net/http`, `encoding/json`, `context`, `net/url`).
- Streaming deserialization with `json.NewDecoder` bounded by `io.LimitReader`.
- Memory ceiling: peak RSS <= 5 MiB in background operations.
- Do not duplicate buffers or retain raw HTTP responses in memory unnecessarily.

---

## 7. Prohibited Actions

- Coupling `go-trakt` to `Dango` concepts (Plex, webhooks, SQLite, sync loops).
- Importing `Dango` packages or logic into `go-trakt`.
- Using mutable global variables or shared static state.
- Making real HTTP requests to Trakt during unit tests (use `httptest.Server`).
- Hardcoding OAuth2 tokens, credentials, or personal secrets.
- Adding third-party external dependencies.
- Ignoring or discarding `context.Context` cancellation.
