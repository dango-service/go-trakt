Project rules for Claude Code assistants:

Refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all repository
rules, Go style conventions, architectural invariants, resource limits, and prohibitions.

## Specific notes for Claude Code

- Never run tests that require real internet connectivity; all tests must use local mocks via `httptest.Server`.
- All modifications must follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 (see [docs/ai/commits.md](docs/ai/commits.md)).
- Zero external dependencies beyond the Go standard library.
- Always use `io.LimitReader` on streaming deserializers.
